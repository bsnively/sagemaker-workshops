  Lab 5:  

Deploying Models and A/B Testing
================================

Step 1
------

Introduction

In this section, we'll use the HPO results from Lab 1/2 and deploy the 3 models we built. Often times you'd take only the best model, but this will give us 3 models that we can deploy to and endpoint and then load balance across all three of them with various weights.

Step 2
------

Deploying our endpoint


#. 
   Select the ModelDeployment/ModelDeploymentExamples.ipynb notebook

      :target: images/lab4/pic1.png
      :alt: 


#. 
   **IMPORTANT:** Replace the HPO job name with the job name from labs 1/2

#. 
   Execute the next cell, it will wait if the tuner is still running.

      :target: images/lab4/pic3.png
      :alt: 


#. 
   We can use the Tuning Analytics to pull a dataframe that contains the various tuning jobs. We'll use these 3 jobs we ran earlier to push out an endpoint that has 3 different models behind it.

#. 
   We can loop through and create SageMaker models for each of the jobs. We need to do this in order to have SageMaker back the model behind the endpoint


   .. image:: images/lab4/pic5.png
      :target: images/lab4/pic5.png
      :alt: 


#. 
   The next cell will now create an endpoint configuration with equal weights across all three models, and then create and endpoint w/ that configuration

#. 
   If you look in SageMaker under Endpoint Configurations, you can see the three models configured under the endpoint you just created.

#. 
   If you look in SageMaker under Endpoint Configurations, you can see the three models configured under the endpoint you just created.


   .. image:: images/lab4/pic7.png

#. 
   And you can see the endpoint itself under the "Endpoints" section
